
% A short explanation for 3 data requirements

% There are three data requirements: 1) Data stationarity 2) Data
% Markovicity 3)Data resolution. If data are simulated then all we need to
% do is to check the third requirement since simulated data are stationary and
% Markov by their construction. However, if data are real then we have to check the
% three data requirements. 
% 
% If the first requirement fails, i.e, the dataset is not stationary then we should chunk data into smaller time periods
% so that the smaller datasets over these periods are stationary and repeat reconstruction over each time period. This
% is called 'moving-window' approach.
% 
% If the second requirement is not met, i.e., data are not Markov, then you should find a quntity
% called 'Markov-Einstein' (ME) time scale. If ME = 1 then your data is Markov and you can analyze the 
% entire dataset. However, if ME>1 then your data is not Markov but a rarified sample with every ME-th data points
% is Markov and analysis must be performed on this rarified sample (or more rarified samples) not the entire dataset.

% The third requirement (data resolution):
% For all datasets (real or simulated) it is necessay to check data resolution and find to
% which category data resolution falls. As explained for the second requirement, you must check the
% resolution of a rarified sample which is Markov not the entire dataset. To investigate data resolution 
% you should find a quantity called the 'Relaxation time' (RT) using the command 'RelaxationTime'. Here, we
% have 3 categories as below:

% 1) RT<=50, which signifies that data falls in the category of 'low-resolution'
% 1) 50<RT<=100, which signifies that data falls in the category of 'medium-resolution'
% 1) RT>100, which signifies that data falls in the category of 'high-resolution'
% If data resolution is medium or high then you can follow 'Euler'
% reconstruction. Otherwise a 'Hermite' reconstruction must be followed

% We explain these data requirements as well as how to reconstruct a dataset in details across the 8 datasets
% corresponding with Figures 2-9 in the paper. Two datasets are real datasets from Ecology (Figure 5) and the
% climate(Figure 9). The details of these datasets are discussed in the paper.

%%
% Figure 2 (Analyzing a high-resolution dataset simulated from a linear model)

% This is a simulated dataset. So, we only check the third data requirement in below
S = load('OUdata1D.mat');data = S.data;  %load the data
data=data(1:20000); %This is a big timeseries with 10^6 data points. Here, we just use 
%its first 20000 data points
RT = RelaxationTime(data);

% Here, we find that RT = 94.4225 (50<RT<100) meaning that this dataset has a medium 
% (but close to high) resolution. So, we follow a Euler reconstruction in below

% This is a real dataset (a climate record covering the northern hemisphere climate from 70000 to 20000 years before the present time). So, we must check the three data requirement in below
data = readmatrix('NGRIP20.csv');   % Load the data
data=data(2649:5081);  % this corresponds with time period from 70000 to 20000 years before the present time

%1) Test of stationarity (if the test result is 1, as it is, then data are stationary)
[~,~,~,~,reg] = adftest(data,'model','ARD','lags',0:10);  % the input 0:10 is the number of lags we try in fitting an autoregressive model to data (it should be big enough. See next command). 
[~,lagndx] = min([reg(:).BIC]);  % this tells us how many lags we need (lagndx is 5<10. So, considering 10 lags in the previous command was enough. Otherwise, increase it and repeat the process)
[h, Pvalue,~]=adftest(data,'model','ARD','lags',lagndx);   % h is the test result with a pvalue of Pvalue (here h = 1, so the dataset is stationary)

%2) Test of Markovicty 
%NOTE: Here you need the 'Burg' folder. So, you should add its path to your
%working folder by typing the command 'addpath('The path of the Burg folder')' 
order = 10;  % Number of autoregressive lags to consider (should be big enough. Continue reading ... you will understand if this lag (10) is enough ro not)
AR = ME_TimeScale(data,order);

% Here you get the following AR vector
%1.0000   -0.4796   -0.2098   -0.1082   -0.0616   -0.0197   -0.0468

% Ignore the first element (which is always 1). The lag after which the
% rest of lements of AR are 0 is the 'Markov-Einstein' (ME) time scale. This real dataset shows long-range correlations. However, 
% after lag 3 (-0.1082) the correlations are rather samll and we can  roughly say that ME time scale is 3. Unfortunately, this dataset is quite
% small with only 2433 data points, so considering a rarified sample with every third points severely shrinks the data. We, therefore, decided to
% consider every othewr data points data(1:2:end) for the analysis, so the ME = 2.  A dataset is Markov if it has a ME time scale of 1. Otherwise, the
% entire dataset is not Markov. However, in this dataset if we consider every other data point, data(1:2:end), then this rarified sample is nearly Markov. We call it Markov sample 

% Checking the resolution of Markov sample
% Note: We must investigate the resolution of a rarified sample which is Markov not the dataset. Here the Markov
% sample consist of every third data point data(1:3:end).
RT = RelaxationTime(data(1:2:end));   % Relaxation time of the Markov sample

% Here, we find that RT = 15.0951<50 meaning that the Markov sample has a low-resolution. So, we apply a Hermite reconstruction

% Applying Hermite reconstruction using spline modeling 
% This has two phases: in the first phase we still follow Euler reconstruction to get a rough result. In the second phase a Hermite
% reconstruction is performed to improve the Euler reconstruction outcomes

% First and second phases (Euler and Hermite reconstructions)

% would consider dt = 2 then drift parameters will be divided by 2 and diffusion parameters will be divided by sqert(2), so on.
