This repository contains a MATLAB package called the 'MATLAB Reconstruction Package'. This package implements a maximum-likelihood estimation procedure to fit the following stochastic Langevin system to univariate time series data with different resolutions (this process is known as 'system reconstruction'):

                                     dx = mu(x) dt + sigma(x) dW,
where mu(x) is the drift function, sigma(x) is the diffusion function, and 𝑑𝑊 represents Brownian noise, which is uncorrelated and Gaussian. The package can reconstruct both high-resolution and low-resolution data. For high-resolution data, the Euler method (termed 'Euler reconstruction') is implemented, while for low-resolution data, a more accurate methodology pioneered by Aït-Sahalia (termed 'Hermite reconstruction') is implemented. For details of both methods, please refer to the publication: Aït‐Sahalia, Y. (2002). Maximum likelihood estimation of discretely sampled diffusions: a closed‐form approximation approach. Econometrica, 70(1), 223-262.

This package supports two different modeling procedures: parametric reconstruction and spline reconstruction (for both low and high-resolution data).

Parametric Reconstruction: The user specifies a parametric model for the drift and diffusion functions (e.g., mu(x) = ax^3-bx^2, sigma(x) = c) and the package estimates the model parameters. Spline Reconstruction: The user does not need to specify any model. Instead, a coarse mesh across the state space, called 'knots sequence', should be specified. Spline modeling is more accurate, especially for Hermite reconstruction which is used for low-resolution data, and is useful when choosing a model is challenging.

This package includes:

A paper titled 'Reconstructing Langevin Systems from High and Low-Resolution Time Series using Euler and Hermite Reconstructions'

An appendix with solid mathematical descriptions

A user-friendly tutorial

Recommended Learning Strategy

Depending on your needs, follow these steps to learn how to use the package:

Quick Analysis: Briefly review the paper, which contains five case studies (three simulated data sets and two real data sets from ecology and climate science). Execute the multi-section code 'AllFigures.m' to reproduce the examples in the paper. Then, use the codes for your own data.

Intermediate Learning: Run the codes in the folder called 'Examples', which contains 10 case studies for various datasets.

In-Depth Learning: Read the tutorial, which contains in-depth but user-friendly explanation about the modeling details and includes 16 case studies for a range of simulated and real datasets.

Advanced Learning: Study the appendix carefully for a more in-depth understanding of the mathematics, and refer to the references provided.
